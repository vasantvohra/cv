    - Created, annotated, augmented, and trained the dataset of 300 Indian trucks images using YOLOv2, applied a Non-maximum suppression algorithm to retain bounding box with maximum probability for plate detection.
    - Additionally, trained a Multilayer Perceptron classifier for digit recognition on the license plate.
